# predpupil

This repository contains files related to a pupillometry study.

In order to create the behaviour csv, only running the 'create_all_behav_dfs.m' is neccessary, as it calls the other two functions.

For creating the pupil csv, run first the 'pupil_to_csv_and_downsampling.ipynb' in python and then 'pupil_preproc_fieldtrip.m' in matlab.

Will be updated with more scripts shortly.
